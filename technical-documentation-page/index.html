                <h3> What is HTML 5? </h3>
                <p> HTML 5 is the fifth and current major version of HTML, and subsumes XHTML. The current standard, the
                    HTML Living Standard is developed by WHATWG, which is made up of the major browser vendors (Apple,
                    Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), with the Living Standard also existing in an abridged version.</p>

            <h3>What are the Features of HTML 5?</h3>
            <p>Many new syntactic features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical
                content, the new video, audio and canvas elements were added, and support for scalable vector
                graphics (SVG) content and MathML for mathematical formulas. To enrich the semantic content
                of documents, new page structure elements such as main, section, article, header,
                footer, aside, nav, and figure are added. New attributes are
                introduced, some elements and attributes have been removed,
                and others such as a, cite, and menu have been
                changed, redefined, or standardized.</p>
