                <h3> What is HTML? </h3>
                <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                    displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                    and scripting languages such as JavaScript. </p>

                <h3>Mark Up</h3>
                <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
                    character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come
                    in pairs like < h1> and </ h1>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for
                    example < img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they
                        are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>

                <h3>Elements</h3>
                <p>
                    An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document or web
                    page. HTML is composed of a tree of HTML nodes, such as text nodes. Each node can have HTML
                    attributes specified. Nodes can also have content, including other nodes and text. Many HTML nodes
                    represent semantics, or meaning. For example, the < title> node represents the title of the
                        document.

            <article>
                <h3>Attributes</h3>
                <p>
                    Most of the attributes of an element are name-value pairs, separated by = and written within the
                    start tag of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double
                    quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not
                    XHTML). Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe. In contrast with
                    name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element simply by their
                    presence in the start tag of the element, like the ismap attribute for the img element.
